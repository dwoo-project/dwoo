1. Block plugins 
-----------------

This version introduced a backward compatibility break with block plugins, this
was needed to allow compile-time access to the block's (parsed) content, be
very careful if you manipulate this content since it is php code and should remain
so if you don't want syntax errors (which are fatal) during template run.

Error message :
	
	Strict Standards: Declaration of Dwoo_Plugin_*::postProcessing() should be compatible with that of Dwoo_Block_Plugin::postProcessing()

Solution :

	* Change your block plugins postProcessing method declaration to the following :
	
		public static function postProcessing(Dwoo_Compiler $compiler, array $params, $prepend, $append, $content)
	
	* Then add "$content" to the beginning of your return value, or modify it if required 
	
2. Strip modifier
-----------------

The strip modifier had the same name as the strip block, this worked when the block
was hard coded within the compiler, but with the API change (see above) I was able
to move it to a plugin. Since both plugins don't have the same purpose, there was
a real problem and I had to rename it. The renaming will be handled by the smarty compatibility
layer, but if you used it without smarty compatibility, you should edit your templates.
