[2008--] 0.9.1
+ Syntax: Mixing named and unnamed parameters is now allowed, as long as the
  unnamed ones appear first
+ Syntax: Added {/} shortcut that closes the last opened block
* Optimized scope-handling functions, {loop} and {with} are now slightly faster
* Fixed a bug in {date_format} that prevented anything but unix timestamps to
  work
* {literal} and {strip} now follow the LooseOpeningsHandling setting
* Fixed complex variables (i.e. {$_root[$c[$x.0]].0}) parsing bugs
* Fixed $dwoo->addResource() breaking if the resource class was not loaded yet,
  autoload should now be called (thanks mike)

[2008-05-10] 0.9.0
! BC Break: changed all class names to be PEAR compliant (aka use underscores
  to separate words/paths), sorry about that but I better do it now than in
  six months
! BC Break: $dwoo->output() and get() have been swapped internally, but it
  doesn't change anything for you unless you called output(*, *, *, true)
  directly to emulate get(). This was done to reduce some overhead
! BC Break: $dwoo->getTemplate() changed to $dwoo->templateFactory() and
  $dwoo->getCurrentTemplate() changed to $dwoo->getTemplate() for consistency
  among all classes and factory functions
+ Added a compiled version of Dwoo that loads faster (especially with opcode
  caches such as APC), include Dwoo.compiled.php instead of Dwoo.php on
  production but if you want to file a bug use Dwoo.php please as it allows
  you to get the proper file/line number where an error occurs. Do not remove
  all other files however since they are not all included in the compiled
  package
+ Plugins: Added {extends} and {block} to handle template inheritance, read
  more about it at http://wiki.dwoo.org/index.php/TemplateInheritance
+ Plugins: Added {loop} that combines {foreach} and {with}, see
  http://wiki.dwoo.org/index.php/Block:loop for details
+ Plugins: Added {do} that executes whatever you feed it whitout echoing the
  result, used internally for extends but you can use it if required
+ Plugins: Added {eol} that prints an end of line character (OS-specific)
+ Syntax: Added shortcut for {$dwoo.const.*} using '%', for example you can use
  {%FOO} instead of {$dwoo.const.FOO}
+ Syntax: When using named parameters, typing a parameter name without any
  value is the same as typing param=true, for example {foo name="test" bar} and
  {foo name="test" bar=true} are equals, can be useful for very complex plugins
  with huge amounts of parameters.
+ Syntax: Added support for {$foo+=5}, {$foo="a"}, {$foo++} and {$foo--}
+ Syntax: Added shortcut for $dwoo.*, you can now use {$.foreach.foo} instead
  of {$dwoo.foreach.foo} for example, applies to all $dwoo.* vars
+ Syntax: Added $ as a shortcut for current scope, $_ for $_parent and $__ for
  $_root
+ API: Added getSource(), getUid() and getResourceIdentifier() to Dwoo_ITemplate
+ API: Added setSecurityPolicy() too Dwoo_ICompiler and modified the arguments
  of its compile() method
+ API: Added a bunch of utility functions to Dwoo_Compiler, allowing compiled
  plugins to access more of the compiler internals
+ Both cache and compile IDs can now have slashes in them to create subfolders
  in the cache/compile dirs
+ Added a DWOO_CHMOD constant that, if set before you include Dwoo, allows you
  to define the file mode of all the file/directories Dwoo will write, defaults
  to 0777
+ Added a 'data' argument to {include} to be able to feed data directly into it
* The compiler now throws Dwoo_Compilation_Exception exceptions upon failure
  and security problems lead to a Dwoo_Security_Exception being thrown. Runtime
  plugin errors and such trigger simple php errors to allow the template
  execution to complete
* Fixed a potential concurrency issue (thanks to Rasmus Schultz for the patch)
* Moved all files to Dwoo/Class.php excepted for the core Dwoo.php file
* Various performance improvements, including the removal of a lot of isset()
  calls. Doing {$foo} if foo is undefined will now display a PHP warning, but
  doing {foreach $foo}..{/foreach} will not however, that way you don't have
  to do {if isset($foo)} before the foreach, but automated isset() calls don't
  impact performance as much as they did before.
* API: Dwoo_ITemplate->clearCache now requires a Dwoo instance as its first arg,
  should not affect you unless you built a custom template class from scratch
* Reworked Dwoo template rendering to avoid variable conflicts with plugins
* {include} now uses the current resource if none is provided instead of using
  file as it did before
* Dwoo uses include path instead of absolute includes
* Changed all line endings to Unix (line feed only) and all spaces left have
  been converted to tabs (tabspace 4)
* TestFest happened early for Dwoo, lots of new tests and more code covered
* Fixed a regression in the handling of custom class plugins
* Fixed various bugs in the Adapter class and related smarty compatibility
  features
* Fixed a classpath rebuilding bug that occured on some UNIX platforms due to
  glob() returning false sometimes for empty folders
* Fixed a bug in Dwoo_Security_Policy->getAllowedDirectories(), no security
  issue though
* Fixed a bug in Dwoo::setScope affecting {loop} and {with}
* Fixed a parsing bug when doing {"string"|modifier:$var}

[2008-04-09] 0.3.4
! BC Break: DWOO_PATH constant changed to DWOO_DIRECTORY
! BC Break: Smarty's @ operator for modifiers is now reversed, for example
  $array|reverse will reverse the items of that array while $array|@reverse
  will reverse each item of the given array (as if you used array_map)
+ Syntax: Added support for method calls on objects i.e. {$foo->bar()}
+ Added support for smarty security features, see the DwooSecurityPolicy class
  and $dwoo->setSecurityPolicy()
+ API: Added a DwooCompiler->setLooseOpeningHandling() method that, if set to
  true, allows tags to contain spaces between the opening bracket and the
  content. Turned off by default as it allows to compile files containing
  css and javascript without the need to escape it through {literal} or \{
+ Added DWOO_CACHE_DIRECTORY and DWOO_COMPILE_DIRECTORY constants that you can
  set before including Dwoo.php to override the defaults (although
  Dwoo->setCacheDir/setCompileDir() still work to change that if required)
+ Added the DwooException class
+ Smarty: Added partial support for register_object(), unregister_object() and
  get_registered_object(). All features can not be supported by the adapter
  though so you might get compatibility warnings
* Fixed {elseif} bug that appeared when multiple elseif tags were used in a row
* Syntax: Improved simple math support to work within variable variables
  (i.e. you can do {$array[$index+1]}) and within strings as well. To prevent
  this enclose the variables in backticks (i.e. {"$foo/$bar"} will do the math
  while {"`$foo`/$bar"} won't as $foo is properly delimited)
* Changed DwooLoader::addDirectory() so that it writes the class paths cache
  into DWOO_COMPILE_DIRECTORY, that way you don't have to make your plugin
  directory writable
* Made all the error triggering more consistent
* Changed automatic cacheId generation in DwooTemplateFile/String to be faster

[2008-03-19] 0.3.3
+ Syntax: Added support for $dwoo.const.CONSTANT and
  $dwoo.const.Class::CONSTANT to read PHP constants from the template
+ Syntax: Added support for on/off/yes/no, that work as aliases for true/false
+ Syntax: Added the $dwoo.charset global variable
+ Plugins: Added {withelse} and made {with} compatible with {else} also
+ API: Added left/right delimiters customization, see DwooCompiler->setDelimiters()
+ API: Added DwooCompiler->triggerError()
+ API: Added Dwoo->clearCache() and DwooITemplate->clearCache() methods
+ Smarty: The smartyCompat prefilter converts {section} tags into {for} tags on the
  fly, however it's not guaranteed to work with *all* section tags, let me know if
  it breaks for you
* {with} now skips the entire block if it's variable doesn't exist, so by
  itself it acts as if you would do {if $var}{with $var}{/with}{/if}
* Each resource has a compiler factory function assigned to it, allowing you to
  easily provide a custom compiler without loading it on every page
* OutputFilters are now simply called Filters (they still use DwooFilter)
* Pre/PostFilters have become Pre/PostProcessors (they now use DwooProcessor)
* Compiler: Fixed parsing bug that prevented function names of 1character
* Compiler: Changed internal handling of variables to fix some errors being
  thrown with specific cases
* Reorganized Dwoo/DwooCompiler and fully commented all the core classes
  and interfaces

[2008-03-09] 0.3.2
+ Added access to superglobals through $dwoo.get.value, $dwoo.post.value,
  etc.
+ Added outputFilters to Dwoo (use Dwoo->addOutputFilter and
  Dwoo->removeOutputFilter)
+ Added preFilters and postFilters to DwooCompiler (use
  DwooCompiler->addPreFilter, etc)
+ Added a html_format output filter that intends properly the html code,
  use it only on full page templates
+ Plugins: Added {for} and {forelse} which allow to loop over an array or to
  loop over a range of numbers
+ Plugins: Added {mailto}, {counter}, {eval}, {fetch} and {include}
+ Syntax : Enhanced support for implicit math operations,
  {$var+$var2*var3+5} now works. Operations are executed from left to right
  though, there is no operator priority. (i.e. 1+1*2 = (1+1)*2 = 4, not 3)
+ API: Added resources support through DwooITemplate implementations and
  Dwoo->addResource()
+ API: Added Dwoo->getTemplate() to get the currently running template object
+ API: Added DwooCompiler::getInstance() to use only one compiler object when
  rendering from the default compiler and to provide you with a singleton if
  it's easier, however the class is not a singleton in the sense that it can
  be instantiated separately
+ API: Added a factory method on DwooITemplate to support resources creation
+ Added a release tag so that all compiled templates are forced to recompile
  after an update, however it is recommended to cleanup your "compiled"
  directory now and then as each release uses new filenames
+ Added an abstract DwooFilter class that you can extend to build filters
* PHP function calls are now case insensitive
* Syntax: The compiler now parses expressions before modifiers, allowing for
  {$var/2|number_format} for example
* DwooTemplateFile now extends DwooTemplateString instead of the other way
  around as it was before
* {else} is now a general purpose plugin that can act as 'else' for foreach,
  for and if/elseif, foreachelse is still available though

[2008-03-05] 0.3.1
+ Added {cycle} function
+ Syntax : Enabled support for associative arrays using
  array(key="value", key2=5) for example, which you can assign or use in a
  foreach directly
+ Syntax : Added support for {$var +-/*% X} (i.e. {$var + 4}), useful for
  simple math operations without the math plugin
+ API : Added append/appendByRef to DwooData
+ Completely rebuilt DwooSmartyAdapter, it should "work" and fail silently if
  you use a non supported function now, however you can set
  $smarty->show_compat_errors=true; on it to receive notices about unsupported
  features that you use
* Bug fixed in {literal} parsing
* Bug fixed in smarty functions handling
* API : Moved Plugin types constants to Dwoo so the compiler doesn't have to
  be loaded unles really required
* API : Moved globals and var reinitialization in Dwoo into their own methods
  so that child classes can easily add globals
* Some improvements in the compiler output
* Some changes in the cache handling of DwooTemplateFile
- Special thanks to Andrew Collins that found many of the bugs fixed in this
  release

[2008-03-02] 0.3.0
+ Full template cache support
+ DwooTemplateString class to load templates from a string
+ Dwoo::VERSION constant
+ {dump} plugin to print out variables
+ Unit tests (with PHPUnit) covering 73% of the codebase right now, which
  should help reducing regression bugs in the next versions.
+ Started commenting (with phpdocs) properly all the classes, should be
  complete for 0.4.0
* {capture} is now compilable and has a new boolean flag to append output into
  the target variable instead of overwriting
* {foreach} supports direct input (instead of only variables), allowing
  constructs like {foreach array(a,b,c) val}{$val}{/foreach} for example that
  would output abc.
* pre/postProcessing functions in block plugins now receive an array of named
  parameters instead of numbered
* Major refactoring of DwooTemplateFile and DwooCompiler
* Cleaned up members visibility in Dwoo/DwooCompiler
* Fixes in the compiler parsing and general variables handling
* Multiple bugfixes here and there thanks to the unit tests
* Optimized {foreach} a lot

[2008-02-19] 0.2.1
* Compiler fixes for argument parsing and handling of Smarty plugins

[2008-02-14] 0.2.0
+ Added support for plugins made for Smarty (that includes modifiers,
  functions and blocks). Not thoroughly tested.
+ Major API changes in the way Dwoo must be run, it's now much more
  flexible and should not change too much in the future.
+ Added support for custom plugins, filters should come in the next version
  although the API to register them is already in.
